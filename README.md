# ⚙ How to Setup

You need to create Drver Kernel and when it's done you put the Source in the Driver folder.
It's time for fun / use it at your own risk
Other question & help / Discord Server



# ❌ You cannot use public drivers like mapper because they are old versions. I recommend you to create your own will be the best.

We set Source to not re-use the driver. That's why we let you create it yourself.
